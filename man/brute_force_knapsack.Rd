\title{An implementation of the brute force solution to the knapsack problem
Where we list all possible combinations of a vector with size \{0,1\}\*n and then make it into
a matrix and check each row for best possible value. The matrix has the size 2^n rows and n columns.}
\usage{
brute_force_knapsack(x, W, parallel = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data.frame with two vectors of the same size, v with values and w with weights}

\item{W}{an integer as the total weight of the knapsack}
}
